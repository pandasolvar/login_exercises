## Modern Login Page

An improvement on my design this is a straight forward login page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

# Features:

* Login form with email and password fields
* Option to check "Remember Me" to store the user's login credentials
* Forgot Password link to reset a forgotten password
* Login with Google and Facebook buttons
* Responsive design for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices

# HTML Structure

The HTML structure includes a <form> element with two <input> fields for email and password, a "Remember Me" checkbox, a "Forgot Password" link, and a "Log in" button. There are also two social login buttons for Google and Facebook.

# CSS Styling
The CSS styling includes a modern and clean design with a gradient background, custom form inputs, and responsive layout.

# JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code includes functionality for handling form submissions, checking the "Remember Me" checkbox, and handling social login buttons.
